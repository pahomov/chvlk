## Create new component

Creating new component is very simple.
Fork this repo.
And run in your termninal:

```sh
npm run gen -- <ComponentName>
```

And it will create boilerplate for your component consists of:

- `/src/components/<ComponentName>/` **folder**

- `<ComponentName>.md` **documentation with examples**

- `<ComponentName>.snapshot.ts` **jest snapshots**

- `<ComponentName>.test.tsx` **functional jest tests**

- `<ComponentName>.tsx` **component code**

- `index.ts` **index file for the folder**

Structure of single component's folder in details in next section.


## Single component's folder

### `<ComponentName>.md`

Documentation file for [Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/). More about documenting your component you can read [here](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/documenting.html#usage-examples-and-readme-files);


### `<ComponentName>.snapshot.ts`

Here you must touch only `snapshots` constant.
This is the list of objects with `props` property (in future we will pass more objects to get snapshots more rich), were you should pass `props` object for your component snapshot testing. More about *snapshots* you can learn [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html). Also we recommend to watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAuXJVI_bUs).


### `<ComponentName>.test.tsx`

This is the file for your functional tests of component. Here we use [jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/) as test runner and *[expect-library](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html)*.
Also we use Enzyme's [mount](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) to render components without browser environment.


### `<ComponentName>.tsx`

This is the main file, here you must describe your component as you usually do.


### `index.ts`

This is the file just to import your components more comfortable, like:
```jsx static
import Component from 'chvlk/Component';
```
instead of
```jsx static
import Component from 'chvlk/Component/Component';
```

## Adding images

Convert svg into tsx via [svgr](https://svgr.now.sh/)

## Edit code

You can start `styleguidist` for live preview of your changes by running:
```sh
npm start
```

When you want to stop and add your changes to git you have to add files to index:
```sh
git add --all
```
**And run [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) instead of running `git commit`**:
```sh
npm run commit
```
After that just follow tips.

When you finished with `commitizen`, npm will run all tests.

If all test are successful you can push branch and create pull request to `master`.
